# Godot-XCH-dapp-example

This is an example dApp for connecting Godot Game Engine with Sage's WalletConnect commands.

## Setup

1 React server
1.1 Run the following commands to set up and start the dApp:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g serve
serve dist
```
After setting up your React server, you still cannot access the Godot Game Engine directly. You need to export the game first.

2 Godot
2.1 Open Godot and load the project located in the godot-sage-dapp-example folder.
2.2 Make your desired edits and export the project to the export folder.
